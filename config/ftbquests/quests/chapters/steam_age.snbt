				"With your first &8Steel&r under your belt, you can make a &bTool Belt&r to free up inventory space if you're carrying around many tools. It can be equipped in its own &ddedicated Curio slot&r."
				""
				"By default, the hotkey to open the belt is &eR&r, but you can rebind it if you're unhappy. From this menu, you can place tools inside the belt's storage, and swap them with your &dmain-hand tool&r whenever is convenient."
				""
				"The belt has a small initial inventory of a single tool. This can be expanded by combining the belt with &bBelt Pouches&r in an &aAnvil&r - the maximum storage a belt holds is &69 slots&r."
